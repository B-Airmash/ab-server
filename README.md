# Experimental branch: fully invisible prowlers (by xplay)

Finished changes:

- Invisible prowlers aren't shown on mimimap. Starmash prowler radar doesn't work (actually without protocol changes it is broken).
- Invisible prowlers see nobody on mimimap.

Not implemented yet:

- Limit invisibility time somehow.

Also not tested with bots.

## Known bugs

Invisible prowlers are shown as spectating in starmash.
